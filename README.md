# rasIPC.tv - RASPberry powered IPCamera to TV
## About
Pronounced: Ras - Pip - See - Tee - Vee

Goal: Display security cameras on a TV or dedicated Monitor; all managed remotely with a simple and modern WebUI.

> Under Very Heavy Development - NON FUNCTIONAL

raspIPC.tv is a fancy web interface for omxplayer, the Raspberry Pi command line video player.
Loaded up on a Raspberry Pi, a $35 credit card sized computer, It allows you to quickly and easily get your security cameras video feeds displayed on your Television with many great layouts that you can customize.

In CCTV lingo it is an IP-Feed to HDMI adapter with a nice browser interface.

  * Test your cameras by trying to play a stream in VideoLAN Client (VLC Player).
* Raspberry Pi2 or newer.
* MicroSD Memory Card - 8GB - 64GB.

### Suggestions:

* Buy a high quality MicroSD Card, this wont need much space.

### Raspberry Pi Video
> The Raspberry Pi was chosen because it has excellent video performance for such a tiny and affordable little machine. It has hardware support for H264 MPEG4 MJPG MPEG2 video formats which covers basically all IP Cameras. (no h265 sorry)
