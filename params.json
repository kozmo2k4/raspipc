You can find guides online for getting them going and once running you\r\ncan securely access your cameras remotely without exposing them to the dangers of the internet.\r\n\r\n### Online Demo:\r\n* Availability limited, running off a real pi so please be nice: [demo.raspipc.tv](http://demo.raspipc.tv)\r\n\r\n#### Features (95% Complete)\r\n* RSTP/HTTP H264/MJPEG/MPEG2 (TCP) Video Streaming\r\n* 1-10/13/16 Camera Grid Displays\r\n* Multi-language Support\r\n* Letterbox/Stretch/Fill Aspect Ratios\r\n* WebUI for easy setup\r\n  * Drag and drop arrangement\r\n  * OnVif Stream Detection\r\n  * Preview Image\r\n* Stream Watchdog\r\n  * Restarts dropped streams\r\n  * Durring outage, displays next highest priority\r\n* Raspbian Jessie image - boot and go!\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n* Camera feeds in a compatible encoding via RSTP or HTTP.\r\n  * Note that MPEG2 Decoding requires the purchase of an external license.\r\n  * Test your cameras by trying to play a stream in [VideoLAN Client](http://www.videolan.org/).\r\n* Raspberry Pi2 or newer.\r\n* MicroSD Memory Card - 8GB - 64GB.\r\n* SD Card Writer for installing.\r\n* Wired Ethernet for best results, cams will drop out all the time on WiFi.\r\n* TV/Monitor connected via HDMI.\r\n  * FYI: Aspect Ratios will be identical to your display.\r\n  * DVI Adapters work fine.\r\n  * Displays can be powered on/off with a GPIO port and a relay.\r\n\r\n### Suggestions:\r\n* Monitors with wide viewing angles are best for dedicated displays.\r\n* Avoid displays with glossy coatings, anti-glare is supreme for IPC.\r\n* VESA Mounts for Raspberry Pi cases work great.\r\n* Buy a high quality MicroSD Card, this wont need much space.\r\n\r\n### Raspberry Pi Video\r\n> The Raspberry Pi was chosen because it has excellent video performance for such a tiny and affordable little machine. It has hardware support for H264 MPEG4 MJPG MPEG2 video formats which covers basically all IP Cameras. (no h265 sorry)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nayrnet/raspipc/master/screenshots/fourCams.png \"4 Cameras\")\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nayrnet/raspipc/master/screenshots/fiveCamsCustom.png \"5 Cameras Custom\")\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nayrnet/raspipc/master/screenshots/camConfig.png \"Configure\")\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nayrnet/raspipc/master/screenshots/about.png \"About Page\")\r\n",
